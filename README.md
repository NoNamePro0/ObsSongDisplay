## Install & Usage

- Have fun! âœ¨

## Nice to know

> WARNING! If you move the installation folder, you need to create the OBS text layer again!

> WARNING! If you put any letters in the 'Check interval' box, the app will crash and not start again until you change the number in the config. Be careful.

> This is a BETA release. Expect [bugs](https://github.com/NoNamePro0/SongFile/labels/bug)! And please report them
